# [BlueDev](https://github.com/blue-harvest-bluedev)

## Introduction

BlueDev is a reference implementation of the bedrock pattern.
Bedrock pattern is used to share code and configuration between applications.
Itâ€™s a clever way of using Git to remove the pain of having to write boilerplate code over and over again for your microservices (or lambdas), 
but it also provides an easy way to propagate updates to existing projects.

## I want to:
- [Learn about the Bedrock Pattern](BEDROCK_PATTERN.md)
- [Learn how to use the existing bedrocks](HOW_TO_USE_BEDROCKS.md)

## Available Bedrocks
